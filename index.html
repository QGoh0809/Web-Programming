      <h3><strong>What is currently being done well</strong></h3>
      <p>With regards to the sites usability, it achieves a few industry standard Benchmarks for navigation, page
        design, content placement and an understanding of audience. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Navigation: The website successfully implemented a site map, and search facility based on keywords.
          Furthermore there is a functioning navigation bar implemented as a table utilising the &lt;td&gt; and
          &lt;th&gt; elements. (Figure 1)</li>
        <li>Page Design: There is the successful implementation of a photo, as a logo, in the header of the site
          utilising the &lt;img&gt; element - providing brand and identity to the website. (Figure 1) Moreover, it
          should also be noted that the site effectively implements meta tags and alt tags. It also utilises a footer
          and header effectively. </li>
        <li>Content Placement: The copy, at least for the &lsquo; above the line&rsquo; content on the landing page, was
          centred appropriately utilising a division tag with the appropriate use of margins, floats and inline
          properties to organise the text. (Figure 1)</li>
        <li>Understanding of audience: The content would, in all likelihood, be of more interest to an academic or older
          community. With that in mind, the lack of graphics and visual stimulus illustrates an understanding of
          audience. The user&rsquo;s visit the site for the unique information it holds - and don&rsquo;t care for how
          it is delivered.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong><img src="https://titan.csit.rmit.edu.au/~s3724287/media/figure-one.png" alt="figure one" width="630"
            height="276" /></strong>(Figure One)<br /></p>
      <h3><strong>What is currently not being done well</strong></h3>
      <p>Although the site achieved some basic benchmarks, by enlarge it lacks effective consideration of Human Computer
        Interaction in all of the areas previously listed besides understanding of audience: navigation, page design,
        content placement.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Navigation: Although there is a navigation menu, sub menus like the Letters &amp; Post Cards page does not
          contain any indication of which page you are on. This could be resolved with a sub class from the CSS utilised
          to highlight which page you are on in the main navigation (figure 2)</li>
        <li>Page Design: To be frank, the design is dated and disengaging - with a lack of images and graphics to draw a
          broader audience beyond the academic and elderly community. Moreover, the use of colour, although contrasting,
          is also very dated.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Content Placement: Although some pages are formatted correctly, most aren&rsquo;t. For example, the
          Introduction page utilises a &lt;span&gt; tag instead of a simple &lt;ul&gt; lag.</li>
        <li>Not Mobile friendly whatsoever, for example the graphics don't scale and the hamburger menu in non-reactive.
          (figure 3)</li>
      </ul>

          height="212" /></p>
      <p>(Figure Two) / (Figure Three)</p>
      <h3><strong>Redevelopment proposal</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Develop CSS to help mitigate issues with indications, formatting for specific sections, logo spacing and
          scale etc. </li>
        <li>Modernise colour scheme and logo. </li>
        <li>Fix navigation features in sub-menus - maybe include them in the main navigation in the header. </li>
        <li>Re-orientate copy to make sure the above the line content engages audiences further. </li>
        <li>Implement more graphics, photos and multimedia</li>
      </ul>

        <h3 class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">WHAT IT DOES RIGHT</span></strong></h3>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1">With regards to the sites usability, it achieves a few industry standard Benchmarks for navigation, page design, content placement and an understanding of audience. </span></p>
        <ul class="ul1">
        <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>Navigation</strong>: The website successfully implemented a site map, and search facility based on keywords. Furthermore there is a functioning navigation bar implemented as a table utilising the &lt;td&gt; and &lt;th&gt; elements. (Figure 1)</span></li>
        <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>Page Design</strong>: There is the successful implementation of a photo, as a logo, in the header of the site utilising the &lt;img&gt; element</span> <span class="s1">- providing brand and identity to the website. (Figure 1)</span></li>
        <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>Content Placement</strong>: The copy, at least for the &lsquo; above the line&rsquo; content on the landing page, was centred appropriately utilising a division tag with the appropriate use of margins, floats and inline properties to organise the text. (Figure 1)</span></li>
        <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>Understanding of audience</strong>: The content would, in all likelihood, be of more interest to an academic or older community. With that in mind, the lack of graphics and visual stimulus illustrates an understanding of audience. The user&rsquo;s visit the site for the unique information it holds - and don&rsquo;t care for how it is delivered. </span></li>
